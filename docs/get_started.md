## 1. Installation

### 1.1 Prerequisites

#### 1.1.1 Miniconda

**Step 0.** Download and install Miniconda from the [official website](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).

**Step 1.** Create a conda environment with Python 3.10+ and activate it.

> [!NOTE]
> Other Python versions require compatibility verification on your own.

```bash
conda create --name x-anylabeling-server python=3.12 -y
conda activate x-anylabeling-server
```

#### 1.1.2 Venv

In addition to Miniconda, you can also use Python's built-in `venv` module to create virtual environments. Here are the commands for creating and activating environments under different configurations:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv-server
source venv-server/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# venv-server\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

### 1.2 Install Server

#### 1.2.1 Git Clone

**Step a.** Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling-Server.git
cd X-AnyLabeling-Server
```

**Step b.** Install dependencies.

For faster dependency installation and a more modern Python package management experience, we strongly recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as your package manager. uv provides significantly faster installation speeds and better dependency resolution capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> PyTorch requirements vary by operating system and CUDA requirements, so we recommend installing PyTorch first by following the [instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) at PyTorch.

> [!TIP]
> For users in China, you can use a pip mirror, e.g., `-i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple`, to accelerate downloads.

```bash
pip install --upgrade uv

# Option 1: Install core framework only (for deploying custom models)
uv pip install -e .

# Option 2: Install with example dependencies (recommended for first-time users)
# This includes ultralytics and transformers for running demo models
uv pip install -e .[all]
```

> [!TIP]
> If you're new to X-AnyLabeling-Server, we recommend using **Option 2** to install all dependencies so you can run the demo models out of the box. If you only plan to deploy your own custom models without these examples, **Option 1** is sufficient.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to run the `sam3` service stably, make sure you are using Python 3.12 or higher, PyTorch 2.7 or higher, and a CUDA-compatible GPU with CUDA 12.6 or higher.</br>
> For `sam2`, you can directly install the `sam3` dependencies to build it.</br>
> For GLM and other API-based models, you can set the API key via environment variables (e.g., `ZHIPU_API_KEY`) in the terminal, or configure it in the model configuration file. Alternatively, you can deploy and integrate them using vLLM or SGLang.

After installation, you can quickly start the service with the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

> [!TIP]
> **Recommended:** Use the `x-anylabeling-server` command instead, which supports custom configuration files:
> 
> ```bash
> # Start with default configs
> x-anylabeling-server
> 
> # Start with custom config files
> x-anylabeling-server \
>   --config /path/to/custom/server.yaml \
>   --models-config /path/to/custom/models.yaml
> ```
> 
> For more configuration options, see the [Configuration Guide](./configuration.md).

---

You can test the API first to verify your deployed model is loaded correctly:

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# List models
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models

# Run inference
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "your_model_id", "image": "data:image/png;base64,...", "params": {}}'
```

Once the server is normal running, open the [X-AnyLabeling client](https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling) and follow these steps:

1. Configure server connection in [`remote_server.yaml`](https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling/blob/main/anylabeling/configs/auto_labeling/remote_server.yaml):
   - Set `server_url` if you changed the default address/port
   - Set `api_key` if you enabled authentication
2. Launch X-AnyLabeling and press `Ctrl+A` to enable AI auto-labeling
3. Open the model dropdown, navigate to the **CVHub** provider section, and select **Remote-Server**

Now, sit back and let your remote models do the labeling work for you—enjoy the magic! 🤣

> [!TIP]
> For detailed usage instructions for the client, refer to the [X-AnyLabeling User Guide](https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling/blob/main/docs/en/user_guide.md).
